# Agentic Engineering on Azure Infrastructure — Hackathon

> **One hackathon. One workload. Three levels of maturity.**
>
> Every track designs, builds and deploys the **same** Azure workload — the *Contoso Ticketing* platform.
> What changes per level is **how agentically** you get there.

---

## The Idea

| Level | You learn | You still deliver |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 **Beginner** | The building blocks: **agents, skills, prompts and handovers** | The Contoso Ticketing baseline, deployed |
| 🟡 **Intermediate** | Do the same thing in **far fewer prompts** using the latest Copilot features (`/plan`, `/fleet`, custom agents, subagents) | The same baseline, deployed |
| 🔴 **Expert** | Architect → plan → test → build → deploy → document **plus** day-2: **Azure SRE Agent** for desired state & reliability, and **GHAS + Defender for Cloud** for code-to-cloud security | The same baseline, deployed, self-healing and secured |

Because all three tracks land on the identical baseline, **a team that finishes beginner or intermediate can roll straight into the expert track** — their own deployment becomes the expert track's starting point. Teams that start at expert deploy the reference baseline in `infra/` in one command and go straight to day-2.

## The Workload — Contoso Ticketing

A small but realistic, secure-by-default Azure workload. Reference implementation lives in [`infra/`](infra/).

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph rg["rg-ticketing-dev-swedencentral"]
        subgraph vnet["vnet-ticketing-dev-swedencentral (10.10.0.0/16)"]
            subgraph snetapp["snet-app 10.10.1.0/24 · nsg-app"]
                app["App Service (Linux, P0v3)<br/>system-assigned identity"]
            end
            subgraph snetpe["snet-privateendpoints 10.10.2.0/24 · nsg-pep"]
                pep["Private Endpoint"]
            end
        end
        sql["Azure SQL<br/>publicNetworkAccess: Disabled<br/>Entra-only auth"]
        law["Log Analytics + App Insights"]
    end
    app -->|VNet integration| pep --> sql
    app --> law
```

On top of it runs [`src/ContosoTicketing`](src/ContosoTicketing/) — a minimal .NET 8 API exposing
`/healthz`, `/readyz` and `/api/tickets`. Every track deploys the **same** infrastructure *and* the
**same** application, which is what lets the expert labs break, scan and fix your own deployment.
See [the fault and vulnerability contract](docs/concepts/fault-and-vulnerability.md).

**Non-negotiable standards** (all tracks are graded on these):

- Bicep with version-pinned **Azure Verified Modules**, CAF naming `<type>-<workload>-<env>-<region>`, tags `environment`, `workload`, `owner`, `costCenter`
- No public database access — Private Endpoint + private DNS only
- Managed identity everywhere — **no passwords, no connection-string secrets**
- NSGs with an explicit deny-all rule, TLS 1.2+, HTTPS only
- Diagnostics wired into Log Analytics

See [`docs/concepts/workload.md`](docs/concepts/workload.md) for the full specification and acceptance criteria.

## Choose Your Track

| | 🟢 Beginner | 🟡 Intermediate | 🔴 Expert |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Duration** | ~3 h 45 min | ~3 h 45 min | ~4 h as a team; ~6 h solo |
| **Prereq** | Copilot basics | Beginner track or equivalent | A deployed baseline |
| **Focus** | Build the agentic pipeline by hand | Compress it with modern Copilot | Day-2 reliability + security |
| **Guide** | [docs/tracks/beginner.md](docs/tracks/beginner.md) | [docs/tracks/intermediate.md](docs/tracks/intermediate.md) | [docs/tracks/expert.md](docs/tracks/expert.md) |

## Indicative cost for one day

These are **planning ranges**, not a quote: prices vary by region, agreement, usage and telemetry
volume. They assume the supplied `swedencentral` baseline runs for 24 consecutive hours: one
always-on Linux P0v3 App Service plan, a 0.5-vCore minimum General Purpose serverless SQL database,
private networking and low-volume Azure Monitor ingestion. The database can pause after 60 minutes
of inactivity, but the App Service plan cannot.

| Track | Estimated Azure cost / 24 h | Assumption |
|---|---:|---|
| 🟢 Beginner | **€5–€8** | Shared baseline only |
| 🟡 Intermediate | **€5–€8** | Same shared baseline |
| 🔴 Expert | **€7–€14** | Baseline plus the Defender plans used in Lab 6 |

GHAS licensing is a GitHub entitlement and is **not** included. Alerting, Application Insights
ingestion, availability tests and Defender can increase the total. Before deploying, price your
selected region and currency in the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/);
after the exercise, delete the resource group and disable any Defender plans created in Lab 6.

---

## Prerequisites

- A **fork** of this repository in your own GitHub account or organisation, and an Azure subscription
  assigned to your team. Do not deploy into the shared upstream subscription.
- Beginner/intermediate: a scope where your team can create the baseline resources. Expert: also
  `User Access Administrator`, permission to enable Defender plans, and repository-admin access.
- **GitHub Copilot** licence. Expert additionally needs an Enterprise/GHAS-enabled repository.
- **Azure Cloud Shell** or VS Code/Codespaces reopened in the dev container. The examples use Bash;
  native Windows users should use the dev container or Cloud Shell.
- **Azure CLI** with Bicep (`az bicep install`)
- Deploy in a region where the **Azure SRE Agent** is available if you intend to do the expert track: `swedencentral`, `eastus2` or `australiaeast`

### Sign in

```bash
az login
az account show --query "{name:name, id:id, tenantId:tenantId}" -o table
```

> Confirm the subscription and tenant with your coaches before deploying anything.

---

## Quick Start Beginner and Intermediate Track

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/AgenticEngineering-Hackathon-Infrastructure.git
cd AgenticEngineering-Hackathon-Infrastructure
code .
```

In VS Code, choose **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**. The devcontainer installs Azure CLI,
Bicep and the Bicep extension; install and authenticate Copilot CLI separately if you take the
intermediate track. Cloud Shell already provides Bash and Azure CLI.

Then choose your track, open its guide, and execute the hackathon steps for that track.

Before any deployment, edit `infra/main.bicepparam`: choose a unique `workload` or `environment`
token so your resource names cannot collide with another team, and replace the placeholder SQL
administrator values with a Microsoft Entra group or user from **your** tenant. For a group:

```bash
az ad group show --group "<your-sql-admin-group>" \
  --query "{objectId:id, login:displayName}" -o table
```
----
## Expert Track direct deployment

To deploy the reference baseline directly (expert fast-start):

```bash
az deployment sub create \
  --name ticketing-baseline \
  --location swedencentral \
  --template-file infra/main.bicep \
  --parameters infra/main.bicepparam
```

Run the deployment and application publish from Cloud Shell, Copilot CLI or the VS Code terminal.
Run the following **only** as the configured Microsoft Entra SQL administrator on a host connected
to the workload VNet. Standard Cloud Shell normally cannot resolve the private endpoint and is not
a suitable bootstrap host. The idempotent script creates the managed-identity user, its
`db_datareader` grant and `dbo.Tickets` without enabling public SQL access:

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap-ticketing-database.sh --deployment-name ticketing-baseline
```
----
## Track Validation 

After completing the track work, run validation:

```bash
./scripts/validate-infra.sh
dotnet build src/ContosoTicketing
```
